# Citizen Complaints and Engagement System

## Project Overview

The **Citizen Complaints and Engagement System** is a platform that allows citizens to submit feedback or complaints regarding public services.

## How to Run the Project Locally

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/Niyonkuru-olivier/citizen-engagement.git

cd citizen-engagement

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up the Frontend (Angular)
cd citizen-engagement
npm install
ng serve

Access frontend at: http://localhost:4200
### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up the Backend (NestJS)
cd ../backend
npm install
### Create a .env file inside /backend folder with the following:
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword
DB_NAME=citizen_engagement
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
### Then run the backend server:
npm run start:dev
### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Setup MySQL Database
Create a database:
CREATE DATABASE citizen_engagement;
Make sure your database credentials match the .env file

Optionally, import schema from a schema.sql file if provided

### Testing
Use Postman or similar API client to test endpoints like:

POST /auth/login
